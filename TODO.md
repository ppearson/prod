Provisioning
------------

* SSH key support
* Fix/implement correct status waiting
* Provisioning from other file formats (YAML)

Possible provision providers
----------------------------

* Binary Lane

(Only as ideas, likely won't implement them as no need for them personally, but might be good to look at their APIs for ideas / problems)

* Kamatera
* Scaleway


Control
-------

* State-based changes with final state verification, rather than current 'action' based changes with little error checking...
